TileTrail is the first mobile app that I have created. I always enjoyed tricky brain teasers and memory games. One day, I decided to develop such a game on my own. I took inspiration from a retro game with 4 blinking tiles which I always liked to play. I added different modes, in-game currency and themes to make the game more exciting and less monotonous.
Currently, TileTrail is available on the App Store for iPhone.
